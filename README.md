## Heart Attack

A throwback to '80s and '90s coin-operated arcade side-scroller fighting games, Heart Attack tells the story of a rugged, disgruntled, aggressive, and anthropomorphized heart, aptly named Car Dio.

When his old friend Bean (a kidney) shows up on his door step in distress, Bean finds the heart has succumbed to decades of alcoholism and self-loathing from being beaten down by a society that takes him for granted.

Nevertheless, this down-trodden heart is the last hope to rescue the kidney's twin sister, Rena L. (also a kidney).  

With a cause, and a friend by his side, it's finally this heart's turn to fight back, using any and all weapons at his disposal.

Battling a variety of enemies from cholesterol to butter, from anxiety to mean ex-girlfriends, and even himself, the heart has to do everything in his power to save his friends.

But at what cost?  Find out, in Heart Attack!
